# Bulletproof Task Graph System

## Overview

The Maverick platform now features a bulletproof, LangGraph-inspired task graph system that provides:

- **Stateful Graph Management**: Each node maintains persistent state and context
- **Conditional Edge Routing**: Dynamic routing based on execution results and current state
- **Cyclical Workflow Support**: Proper support for feedback loops and iterative workflows
- **Memory Bank**: Persistent context retention across task executions
- **Agent State Transparency**: Full visibility into agent state at all times
- **Robust Recovery Mechanisms**: Multiple recovery strategies for error handling
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Built-in integrity checking and debugging tools

## Core Architecture

### LangGraph Principles Implemented

Based on the LangGraph documentation, our system implements:

1. **Stateful Graphs**: Each node retains information from previous steps, enabling continuous and contextual processing
2. **Conditional Edges**: Functions that determine which node to execute next based on current state
3. **Cyclical Support**: Support for cycles and feedback loops essential for iterative workflows
4. **Memory Bank**: A digital notebook that captures and updates data as it moves through workflow stages
5. **State Transparency**: Full observability of how the system works to complete complex tasks

### State Management Components

#### 1. Project Graphs (`this.projectGraphs`)
- Stateful project graphs with complete state information
- Version tracking and metadata
- Event logging for debugging
- State checkpoints for recovery

#### 2. Graph State (`this.graphState`)
- Current execution state of each graph
- Node availability and completion tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Progress and timing metrics

#### 3. Node States (`this.nodeStates`)
- Individual node execution state
- Input/output state persistence
- Agent assignment and performance tracking
- Error and retry management

#### 4. Memory Bank (`this.graphMemory`)
- Project context and requirements
- Execution history
- Agent knowledge and patterns
- Quality metrics and learned patterns

#### 5. Execution Context (`this.executionContext`)
- Environment and configuration settings
- Resource limits and timeouts
- Quality requirements
- Recovery configuration

## Key Features

### 1. Stateful Graph Creation

```javascript
const statefulGraph = await this.createStatefulGraph(taskAnalysis, projectId, socket);
```

Creates a comprehensive stateful graph with:
- Enhanced task graph with quality checkpoints
- Initialized graph state with availability tracking
- Memory bank with persistent context
- Conditional edges with dynamic routing
- State checkpoints for recovery

### 2. Conditional Edge Routing

```javascript
const conditionalEdges = this.setupConditionalEdges(taskGraph);
```

Features:
- **Dependency Conditions**: Standard task dependencies
- **Quality Gates**: Score-based quality thresholds
- **Agent Availability**: Resource availability checking
- **Cyclical Conditions**: Iteration limits and improvement tracking

### 3. Cyclical Workflow Support

The system detects and handles cycles for:
- **Quality Iteration**: Code → Review → Improve → Re-review cycles
- **Review Cycles**: Task → Review → Rework → Re-review cycles
- **Test-Fix Cycles**: Test → Fail → Fix → Re-test cycles
- **General Improvement**: Iterative refinement workflows

### 4. State Persistence and Recovery

#### Recovery Strategies
1. **Execution Start**: Restore from beginning of execution
2. **Last Successful Node**: Reset to last completed task
3. **Auto Snapshots**: Automatic state snapshots during execution
4. **Initialized State**: Reset to initial graph state

#### Checkpoint System
- Automatic checkpoint creation at key points
- Manual checkpoint creation for debugging
- Checkpoint validation and integrity checking
- Deep cloning to prevent reference issues

### 5. Memory Bank Features

The memory bank provides persistent context:

```javascript
// Project context
memoryBank.set('project:context', { projectId, prompt, requirements });

// Execution history
memoryBank.set('execution:history', [...taskCompletions]);

// Agent knowledge
memoryBank.set('agents:knowledge', agentPerformanceData);

// Quality metrics
memoryBank.set('quality:metrics', { overallScore, testCoverage });

// Learned patterns
memoryBank.set('patterns:learned', successfulPatterns);
```

### 6. Enhanced Error Handling

#### Multi-Strategy Recovery
```javascript
const recoveryStrategies = [
  'execution_start',
  'last_successful_node', 
  'auto-snapshot-before-error',
  'initialized'
];
```

#### Validation and Integrity
- State consistency validation
- Node state integrity checking
- Conditional edge validation
- Memory bank validation
