# Maverick Multi-Agent Orchestration System - High-Level Architecture

## Executive Summary

Maverick is an AI-powered development platform that transforms natural language descriptions into complete, production-ready software projects through intelligent multi-agent orchestration. Built with a focus on the "Always Building" principle, every user interaction results in immediately runnable code.

## System Overview

### Core Architecture

The system follows an **event-driven, multi-agent orchestration pattern** with three main layers:

1. **Frontend Layer**: Modern web interface with real-time Kanban boards and task visualization
2. **Orchestration Layer**: LangGraph-inspired task orchestration with stateful execution
3. **Execution Layer**: Goose CLI integration for actual AI-powered development tasks

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Event-Driven Communication**: WebSocket-based real-time updates via Socket.IO
- **Stateful Task Graphs**: LangGraph-inspired execution with persistent state management
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in code review and QA validation after every task
- **Template-Driven Development**: Pre-configured project templates for rapid generation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Simulation mode when external tools unavailable

## Core Components

### 1. Task Orchestrator (`TaskOrchestrator.js`)
- **Purpose**: Central brain managing task execution and agent coordination
- **Key Features**:
  - Bulletproof stateful graph execution
  - Dependency resolution and parallel task execution
  - Checkpoint/resume functionality
  - Quality gate integration

### 2. Agent Registry System (`agents/`)
- **Specialized Agents**:
  - `ReactFrontendSpecialist`: Modern React development with TypeScript/JavaScript
  - `PythonBackendSpecialist`: FastAPI, Django, Flask backend development
  - `CodeReviewSpecialist`: Security analysis and quality assessment
  - `QATestingSpecialist`: Comprehensive testing strategies and automation
- **Features**: Capability-based assignment, efficiency ratings, skill matching

### 3. Goose Integration (`goose-integration.js`)
- **Purpose**: External CLI process management for AI development tasks
- **Features**:
  - Real-time process monitoring and output parsing
  - Session timeout management with activity tracking
  - Cross-platform process cleanup and resource management

### 4. Job Storage System (`jobStorage.js`)
- **Purpose**: File-based JSON persistence for project state
- **Features**:
  - Three-tier data model (jobs, agents, checkpoints)
  - In-memory operations with immediate persistence
  - UUID-based identification and cross-referencing

### 5. Frontend Interface (`client/public/`)
- **Main Views**:
  - Project dashboard with real-time Kanban boards
  - Agent monitoring and task visualization
  - Task graph visualization with dependency tracking
  - Directory browser for project management

## Data Flow & Execution

### 1. Project Initiation
```
User Input → Prompt Analysis → Task Decomposition → Agent Assignment → Stateful Graph Creation
```

### 2. Task Execution
```
Task Queue → Agent Selection → Goose CLI Execution → Real-time Updates → Quality Gates
```

### 3. Quality Assurance Pipeline
```
Task Completion → Code Review Checkpoint → QA Testing Checkpoint → Final Validation
```

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Intelligent Agent Selection**: Capability-based matching with efficiency ratings
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working simultaneously on different tasks
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic task ordering based on dependencies
- **Quality Gates**: Mandatory code review and QA validation

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Live Kanban Boards**: Visual task progression across todo → inProgress → review → completed
- **Agent Activity Tracking**: Real-time status updates and progress monitoring
- **Task Graph Visualization**: Dependency visualization with execution status
- **Live Update Stream**: Real-time event feed with status messages

### Template System
- **Pre-configured Templates**: React, Angular, Vue, Full-Stack, REST API, Static Website
- **Configurable Options**: Framework choices, styling libraries, feature toggles
- **"Always Building" Principle**: Every template generates immediately runnable projects
- **Multi-Agent Generation**: Specialized agents handle different project aspects

### State Management
- **Persistent Execution State**: Checkpoint system for pause/resume functionality
- **In-Memory State Maps**: Fast access to project graphs, node states, and execution context
- **File-Based Persistence**: JSON storage for long-term project state
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Graceful handling of failures and restarts

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for WebSocket connections
- **Process Management**: Child process spawning for Goose CLI integration
- **Data Storage**: File-based JSON persistence
- **Module System**: CommonJS with modular architecture

### Frontend
- **Core Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript
- **Styling**: CSS Grid/Flexbox with modern responsive design
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO client for live communication
- **UI Components**: Custom Kanban boards, task cards, agent dashboards

### External Integrations
- **Goose CLI**: AI-powered development tool integration
- **Process Management**: Cross-platform process lifecycle management
- **File System**: Dynamic directory browsing and project management

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Built-in Quality Gates
- **Code Review Specialist**: Security analysis, best practices validation, architecture review
- **QA Testing Specialist**: Unit testing, integration testing, E2E testing automation
- **Checkpoint System**: Mandatory validation between task dependencies
- **Final Project Reviews**: Comprehensive project-wide quality assessment

### "Always Building" Validation
- **Immediate Runnability**: Every output must be immediately executable
- **Complete Dependencies**: Full package.json with all required dependencies
- **Build Scripts**: Development and production build configurations
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated README files with setup instructions

## Configuration & Deployment

### Environment Configuration
- **Development Mode**: Full Goose CLI integration with real AI agents
- **Simulation Mode**: Fallback mode for demonstration without external dependencies
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for different task complexities
- **Resource Limits**: Agent limits and process management safeguards
