## 🏗 Architecture

### Enhanced Multi-Agent Orchestration with Quality Checkpoints

#### Task Flow Architecture
```
Task Creation → Agent Assignment → Task Execution → Code Review Checkpoint → QA Testing Checkpoint → Task Completion → Next Task(s)
```

### Agent Hierarchy
- **Standard Agents**: Frontend, Backend, Database specialists (perform actual development work)
- **Quality Gate Agents**: Code Review and QA Testing specialists (validate work quality)
- **Orchestrator**: Manages task flow, dependencies, and quality gates

### Client-Side
- **Modern Frontend**: Clean, responsive interface with real-time checkpoint monitoring
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live monitoring of tasks and quality gates
- **Quality Dashboard**: Visual representation of checkpoint progress and quality metrics
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works across all modern browsers

### Server-Side
- **Enhanced Task Orchestration**: Intelligent task breakdown with automatic quality checkpoints
- **Quality Gate Integration**: Mandatory code review and QA checkpoints after every task
- **Dependency-Aware Scheduling**: Tasks only proceed after quality gates pass
- **Goose CLI Integration**: Advanced AI agent capabilities with checkpoint awareness
- **Project Management**: Directory handling, build validation, and quality assurance

### AI Agent Types

#### Standard Development Agents
- **Frontend Specialists**: React, Vue, Angular experts
- **Backend Specialists**: API development and server-side logic  
- **Database Architects**: Schema design and optimization
- **DevOps Engineers**: Deployment and infrastructure

#### Quality Gate Agents (Checkpoints)
- **Code Review Specialists**: Code quality, security, and best practices validation
- **QA Testing Specialists**: Comprehensive testing, quality assurance, and deployment readiness
- **Final Review Agents**: Project-level quality validation before completion

#### Quality Assurance Process
1. **Task-Level Checkpoints**: Every standard task automatically gets code review → QA testing checkpoints
2. **Dependency Routing**: Subsequent tasks depend on checkpoint completion, not just task completion
3. **Quality Gates**: Code review and QA testing must pass before dependent tasks can begin
4. **Final Project Review**: Comprehensive code review and QA testing of the entire project
5. **Rework Handling**: Failed checkpoints trigger automatic task rework with specific guidance

## 🎨 User Interface

### Clean Design Principles
- **Broadcom Branding**: Modern color scheme with Broadcom red accents
- **Typography**: Inter font family for excellent readability
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing system for visual harmony
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant design with proper focus states

### Responsive Layout
- **Desktop-First**: Optimized for development workflows
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Full functionality on tablets and phones
- **Touch-Optimized**: Large touch targets for mobile interaction

### Dark/Light Support
- **System Preference**: Respects user's system theme preference
- **High Contrast**: Excellent readability in all conditions
- **Consistent Theming**: Unified color system across all components

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=3000
GOOSE_PATH=/path/to/goose/cli
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Goose CLI Setup

Ensure Goose CLI is properly configured:

```bash
# Check installation
goose --version

# View configuration
goose config --show

# Configure for your environment
goose config --set key=value
```
